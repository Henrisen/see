## Installing

The `see` tool is a command-line utility for viewing files in a user-friendly manner. Follow the steps below to install `see` on your supported operating systems. Ensure you have `curl` installed.

### For Linux and macOS

#### 1. Check if `curl` is installed

Run this command to check if `curl` is installed:

```bash
command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "YES" || echo "NO"
```

If the previous command outputs `YES`, then `curl` is installed and you can continue.

If it returns `NO`, then `curl` is not installed. In this case, please check how to install `curl` on your system and then repeat this step.

#### 2. Download the Installer from the Official GitHub

Remove any outdated installer from your current working directory, if present:

```bash
[ -f ./install ] && rm -f ./install
```

Next, use `curl` to download the latest installer:

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Henrisen/see/refs/heads/main/install
```

#### 3. Run the Installer

You will need sudo permissions to run the installer. Use the following commands:

```bash
chmod +x ./install
sudo ./install
```

### Quick Install

To install `see` with a single command:

```bash
command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1 || { echo "curl is not installed. Please install curl and try again."; } && rm -f ./install && curl -s -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Henrisen/see/refs/heads/main/install && chmod +x ./install && sudo ./install
```

## Usage

To use `see`, run it with the name of the file you want to open:

```bash
see example.sh
```

For real-time file updates, use the `-f` / `--follow` flag:

```bash
see -f example.sh
```

For custom update intervals, use the `-u` / `--update-interval` flag (default is 125 ms):

```bash
see -fu125 example.sh
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall `see`, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Henrisen/see.git
cd see
sudo make uninstall
```
